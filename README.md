## script
I have some shellscripts for easy development. Based on the philosophy of "I am another person in the next few months", I explain them.

- build-static.sh: build static site by freeze.py
- run-server.sh: run flask server by run.py
- watch-scss.sh: watch scss file to generate css by sass command
