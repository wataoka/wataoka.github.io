# 🌐 Homepage

This is the source for my personal website. It’s written in pure HTML/CSS (with a huge help from AI tools) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Live site:** [wataoka.github.io](https://wataoka.github.io)

## 📂 Structure
`docs/`           → Live site content (served by GitHub Pages)  
`docs/index.html` → Main page to edit for content changes  
`public/`         → Static assets (images, icons, etc.)  
`v1/`             → First version of the site  
`v2/`             → Current design iteration  

## 🚀 Editing & Publishing
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wataoka/wataoka.github.io.git
   ```
   
2. Edit docs/index.html to update the homepage.

3. Push changes — they go live automatically via GitHub Pages.
